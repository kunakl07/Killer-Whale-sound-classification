# Killer-Whale-sound-classification

Here,we are going to identify Killer whale from their sounds.We are going make spectrograms from the sounds of these whales.
These spectrograms would then be passed to our model where classification of the type of whale would take place.
We are also going to classify the call made by Whale("weeya","double weeya","swoop",etc)depending on the frequency and time variations,that shows a particular pattern of calls made by Killer Whales
